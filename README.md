# Polymorphism
A example program with a brief code showcasing polymorphic abilities.

Dynamic or late binding
Run the Dynamic or late binding example program in your IDE and pay attention to the invoked display method within the Super_Class class. You will learn that binding between the origin of the virtual function (inside the Super_Class) and its replacement (defined within the subclasses) is created dynamically, during the execution of the program. This is also known as late binding and occurs and runtime.
